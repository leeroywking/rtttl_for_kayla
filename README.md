# Hello!

## RTTTL converter for circuit python

### RTTTL is a standard for ring tones and works well for anything you want to play tones for
### [RTTTL on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Text_Transfer_Language)


### We are going to be using a Library that already exists to play the songs, you can find that in the folder labeled "scripts"

## Circuit python

- Circuit python looks for a file named "code.py" at the root directory of its filesystem
- The circuit python device doesn't have very much storage so you cannot put the "unconverted_songs" folder onto the drive

## Setup instructions

- clone this repo down locally
- let the device restart, now when you hit the button on pin D1 it should play a snippet of the aadams family song
